# Implementation Stage {{STAGE_ID}} Review Checklist (Publon {{PUBLON_ID}})

Use this checklist after implementing stage {{STAGE_ID}} and running tests.

Mark items as `[x]` when satisfied, `[ ]` otherwise, and add short notes as needed.

## 1. Scope and objectives

- [ ] The implementation corresponds to the stated objective of stage {{STAGE_ID}}.
- [ ] No major functionality outside the scope of this stage was added.
- [ ] Any changes to scope are reflected in the stage report.

Notes:

{{CHECK_SCOPE_NOTES}}

## 2. Code clarity and structure

- [ ] New or modified functions/methods are short and cohesive.
- [ ] Names (modules, classes, functions, variables) are descriptive.
- [ ] No obvious duplication was introduced; common logic is factored where reasonable.
- [ ] No unused code, parameters, or configuration options were left in place.

Notes:

{{CHECK_CODE_NOTES}}

## 3. Architectural alignment

- [ ] Changes align with the project's architecture guidelines.
- [ ] Responsibilities are assigned to appropriate components.
- [ ] Any deviations from the intended architecture are documented with rationale.

Notes:

{{CHECK_ARCHITECTURE_NOTES}}

## 4. Tests and invariants

- [ ] Unit tests cover the core new/changed functionality.
- [ ] Integration or system tests exercise end-to-end behaviour relevant to this stage.
- [ ] Key invariants are enforced via assertions or validation logic.
- [ ] Tests are deterministic or clearly documented if stochastic behaviour is expected.

Notes:

{{CHECK_TESTS_NOTES}}

## 5. Minimality and non-bloat

- [ ] No generic abstractions were introduced without immediate need.
- [ ] No configuration options, flags, or extension points were added "just in case".
- [ ] Any complexity added has a clear justification in the stage objective or design doc.

Notes:

{{CHECK_MINIMALITY_NOTES}}

## 6. Documentation and links

- [ ] The stage report is complete and linked from publon-level documents if needed.
- [ ] Any relevant parts of `{{PUBLON_ID}}`'s design or spec are updated.
- [ ] Comments in code are concise and explain *why*, not just *what*.

Notes:

{{CHECK_DOCS_NOTES}}
