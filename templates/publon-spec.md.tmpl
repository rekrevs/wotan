## 1. Summary

**Working title:** {{PUBLON_WORKING_TITLE}}

**Short synopsis (2–3 sentences)**

{{PUBLON_SYNOPSIS}}

## 2. Claim and motivation

## 3. Context and related work (sketch)

This is a **lightweight** mapping to key related work, not a full related-work section.

- Closest related system / paper 2: {{RELATED_WORK_2}} (how we differ)
- Other relevant lines of work:
  - {{RELATED_WORK_3}}
  - {{RELATED_WORK_4}}

Later, the full related work will live in the manuscript; this section is to keep design and implementation grounded.
