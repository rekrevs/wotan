_Last updated: {{DATE}}_

## 1. Objective

**Stage ID:** {{STAGE_ID}}

**Publon:** {{PUBLON_ID}} – {{PUBLON_WORKING_TITLE}}

**Objective (1–3 sentences)**

{{STAGE_OBJECTIVE}}

## 2. Acceptance criteria

List concrete criteria that define completion for this stage.

- {{CRITERION_1}}
- {{CRITERION_2}}
- {{CRITERION_3}}

## 3. Changes made

### 3.1 Code and structure

Summarise changes to code and structure (reference modules, classes, functions):

{{CODE_CHANGES_SUMMARY}}

### 3.2 Tests added / updated

List new or modified tests:

- Unit tests:
  - {{UNIT_TESTS}}
- Integration / system tests:
  - {{INTEGRATION_TESTS}}
- Runtime assertions / invariants:
  - {{ASSERTIONS}}

Include paths to test files where helpful.

## 4. Test execution

Document how tests were run and their outcome using the two-tier strategy (see `docs/test-conventions.md`).

**Tier 1: Stage-specific tests (fast feedback)**

- Command used:
  - `{{TIER1_TEST_COMMAND}}`
- Result:
  - {{TIER1_TEST_RESULT}}

**Tier 2: Cumulative regression tests (quality gate)**

- Command used:
  - `{{TIER2_TEST_COMMAND}}`
- Result:
  - All tests passed? {{TIER2_TEST_RESULT}}
  - Any tests intentionally skipped? {{SKIPPED_TESTS_NOTES}}
  - Any tests from earlier stages modified? (If yes, explain why in section 3.2)

## 5. Design decisions

Record any design decisions made during this stage that are important for later:

- Decision 1:
  - Description: {{DESIGN_DECISION_1_DESC}}
  - Rationale: {{DESIGN_DECISION_1_REASON}}
- Decision 2:
  - Description: {{DESIGN_DECISION_2_DESC}}
  - Rationale: {{DESIGN_DECISION_2_REASON}}

If decisions update or resolve items in the publon design doc, reference those sections.

## 6. Known limitations and technical debt

List limitations or debt intentionally left for later stages:

- {{LIMITATION_1}}
- {{LIMITATION_2}}

Indicate whether each item is:

- Critical before experiments
- Optional for later refactoring
- Dependent on other publons

## 7. Checklist and review notes

Refer to the stage review checklist for this stage (see `{{STAGE_CHECKLIST_PATH}}`) and summarise:

- Items flagged during review:
  - {{CHECKLIST_FLAGS}}
- Follow-up actions:
  - {{FOLLOW_UP_ACTIONS}}

## 8. Stage completion status

- Status: `completed` / `in-progress` / `abandoned`
- Notes on completion or reasons for not completing:

{{COMPLETION_NOTES}}
