## Research methodology

This project uses a structured, AI-assisted research methodology based on:

- **Publons** (least publishable units) with their own specs, design docs, and paper skeletons.
- **Implementation stages** (small, test-driven increments).
- **Experiment batches** with explicit plans and logs.
- **Paper passes** for structured writing and editing.

Research-related state lives under the `research/` directory:

- `research/meta/` – project-level meta-plan and venue notes.
- `research/publons/` – per-publon specs, design, stages, experiments.
- `research/dev-log/` – cross-cutting logs.
- `research/papers/` – manuscripts and long-form write-ups.

Templates and prompts come from a separate **methodology repository**, which is treated as read-only. This project repository contains the instantiated, evolving state.
