# Publon {{PUBLON_ID}} – Design and Architecture Notes

_Last updated: {{DATE}}_

## 1. Context

Publon:

- ID: {{PUBLON_ID}}
- Working title: {{PUBLON_WORKING_TITLE}}

Project:

- Name: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Briefly describe how this publon connects to the overall project and system:

{{PUBLON_CONTEXT}}

## 2. Functional goals

List the main functional goals of this publon from a system perspective:

- {{FUNCTIONAL_GOAL_1}}
- {{FUNCTIONAL_GOAL_2}}
- {{FUNCTIONAL_GOAL_3}}

## 3. Non-functional considerations

Non-functional aspects that matter for this publon (if any), e.g.:

- Performance (latency, throughput)
- Resource usage
- Determinism / reproducibility
- Robustness
- Interpretability

List those that are relevant:

- {{NON_FUNCTIONAL_1}}
- {{NON_FUNCTIONAL_2}}

## 4. Architecture impact

Describe which parts of the system are affected:

- Existing components to modify:
  - {{EXISTING_COMPONENT_1}}
  - {{EXISTING_COMPONENT_2}}
- New components to introduce:
  - {{NEW_COMPONENT_1}}
  - {{NEW_COMPONENT_2}}

Sketch expected interactions (textually; diagrams can be added later):

{{ARCHITECTURE_IMPACT_NOTES}}

## 5. Design choices and options

List key design questions and options considered.

Example format:

- **Question 1:** {{DESIGN_QUESTION_1}}
  - Option A: {{DESIGN_OPTION_1A}} (pros / cons)
  - Option B: {{DESIGN_OPTION_1B}} (pros / cons)
  - Decision (current): {{DESIGN_DECISION_1}}

- **Question 2:** {{DESIGN_QUESTION_2}}
  - Options and current decision

Use this section as a living record of design trade-offs.

## 6. Open design questions

Design questions intentionally left open, to be resolved during implementation or after preliminary experiments:

- {{OPEN_QUESTION_1}}
- {{OPEN_QUESTION_2}}

If a question is resolved, move it to the "Design choices and options" section above and record the decision.

## 7. Implementation staging plan (sketch)

High-level plan for implementation stages (`S1a`, `S1b`, …) for this publon.

Example:

- `S1a` – Minimal scaffolding and basic data flow.
- `S1b` – Core algorithm implementation, simple tests.
- `S1c` – Integration with existing components, baseline experiments.

Write an initial list, to be refined in stage-specific reports:
