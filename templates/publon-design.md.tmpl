# Publon {{PUBLON_ID}} – Design and Architecture Notes

_Last updated: {{DATE}}_

## 1. Context

Publon:

- ID: {{PUBLON_ID}}
- Working title: {{PUBLON_WORKING_TITLE}}

Project:

- Name: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Briefly describe how this publon connects to the overall project and system:

{{PUBLON_CONTEXT}}

## 2. Functional goals

List the main functional goals of this publon from a system perspective:

- {{FUNCTIONAL_GOAL_1}}
- {{FUNCTIONAL_GOAL_2}}
- {{FUNCTIONAL_GOAL_3}}

## 3. Non-functional considerations

Non-functional aspects that matter for this publon (if any), e.g.:

- Performance (latency, throughput)
- Resource usage
- Determinism / reproducibility
- Robustness
- Interpretability

List those that are relevant:

- {{NON_FUNCTIONAL_1}}
- {{NON_FUNCTIONAL_2}}

## 4. Architecture impact

Describe which parts of the system are affected:

- Existing components to modify:
  - {{EXISTING_COMPONENT_1}}
  - {{EXISTING_COMPONENT_2}}
- New components to introduce:
  - {{NEW_COMPONENT_1}}
  - {{NEW_COMPONENT_2}}

Sketch expected interactions (textually; diagrams can be added later):

## 5. Design choices and options

List key design questions and options considered.

Example format:

- **Question 1:** {{DESIGN_QUESTION_1}}
  - Option A: {{DESIGN_OPTION_1A}} (pros / cons)
  - Option B: {{DESIGN_OPTION_1B}} (pros / cons)
  - Decision (current): {{DESIGN_DECISION_1}}

- **Question 2:** {{DESIGN_QUESTION_2}}
  - Options and current decision

Use this section as a living record of design trade-offs.

## 6. Open design questions

Design questions intentionally left open, to be resolved during implementation or after preliminary experiments:

- {{OPEN_QUESTION_1}}
- {{OPEN_QUESTION_2}}

If a question is resolved, move it to the "Design choices and options" section above and record the decision.

## 7. Implementation staging plan (sketch)

High-level plan for implementation stages (`S1a`, `S1b`, …) for this publon.

**This plan is iterative:** It will be refined after each minor stage is completed. Plan only 2-5 stages ahead in detail.

### Major stage themes

Identify 2-5 major implementation themes (see `docs/naming-conventions.md`):

- **Major stage 1:** {{MAJOR_STAGE_1_THEME}}
- **Major stage 2:** {{MAJOR_STAGE_2_THEME}}
- **Major stage 3:** {{MAJOR_STAGE_3_THEME}} (if applicable)

### Planned minor stages

**Major stage 1: {{MAJOR_STAGE_1_THEME}}**

- `S1a` – {{STAGE_S1A_OBJECTIVE}}
- `S1b` – {{STAGE_S1B_OBJECTIVE}}
- `S1c` – {{STAGE_S1C_OBJECTIVE}} (if applicable)
- *(Add more as needed)*

**Major stage 2: {{MAJOR_STAGE_2_THEME}}**

- `S2a` – {{STAGE_S2A_OBJECTIVE}} (initial sketch; will refine after S1 completes)
- `S2b` – {{STAGE_S2B_OBJECTIVE}} (tentative)
- *(Details to be refined after major stage 1)*

**Major stage 3+:** *(To be planned after major stage 2)*

### Staging plan evolution log

Track major changes to the plan as implementation progresses:

- **{{DATE}}:** Initial plan created
- *(After each stage, note significant plan changes here)*

Example entries:

- **2025-02-15 (after S1b):** Split S1c into S1c and S1d due to complexity of integration layer
- **2025-02-20 (after S2a):** Merged S2b and S2c; scope was smaller than expected
- **2025-02-25 (after S2b):** Added new S2d to handle edge case discovered during testing
