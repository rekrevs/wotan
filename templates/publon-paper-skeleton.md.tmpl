_Working title: {{PAPER_TITLE}}_

_Target venue (optional): {{TARGET_VENUE}}_

## 1. Introduction

**Core elements:**

- Problem statement:
  - {{INTRO_PROBLEM}}
- Why it matters:
  - {{INTRO_IMPORTANCE}}
- High-level idea:
  - {{INTRO_IDEA}}
- Contributions (bullets):
  - (C1) {{CONTRIB_1}}
  - (C2) {{CONTRIB_2}}
  - (C3) {{CONTRIB_3}}

## 2. Background and related work (high level)

**Goal:** Give just enough context for the contributions to make sense.

Bullets:

- Key concepts and terminology needed.
- Main related lines of work and how they differ from our approach.
- Any assumptions or standard models we rely on.

Later, a dedicated "Related Work" section may be added or expanded; here we focus on what is needed to understand the rest.

## 3. System / Method

Structure this section into subsections; for each, add a short bullet list of content.

### 3.1 Overview

- High-level diagram or description of the system / method
- Main components and how they interact

### 3.2 Components / algorithms

- Component A: {{COMPONENT_A_NOTES}}
- Component B: {{COMPONENT_B_NOTES}}
- Component C: {{COMPONENT_C_NOTES}}

(Add more subsections as needed.)

## 4. Experimental setup

### 4.1 Questions / hypotheses

- Q1: {{HYPOTHESIS_1}}
- Q2: {{HYPOTHESIS_2}}

### 4.2 Datasets / environments

- Datasets / benchmarks: {{DATASETS}}
- Simulation or system environment: {{ENVIRONMENT}}

### 4.3 Baselines and metrics

- Baselines: {{BASELINES}}
- Metrics: {{METRICS}}

## 5. Results

Create subsections that correspond to hypotheses or themes.

### 5.1 Main results

- Tables and figures to include and what they should show.
- Expected or observed trends.

### 5.2 Ablations / sensitivity

- Ablation experiments to understand which components matter.
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters, scales, or conditions.

### 5.3 Qualitative analysis (if applicable)

- Example cases, visualisations, or case studies.

## 6. Discussion

- Interpretation of results.
- Limitations.
- Threats to validity.
- Implications for future work and for practice.

## 7. Related work (full)

- Structured discussion of prior work by theme.
- Clear positioning of this publon relative to each theme.

(May be merged with the background section depending on venue.)

## 8. Conclusion

- Restatement of key contributions.
- Most important takeaway messages.
- Short note on how this publon fits into the broader project.
